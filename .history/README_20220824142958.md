# My personal documentation

I work a lot on personnal projects, especially on a mobile game project.

I make mistakes, and I find solutions. I need to gather these informations somewhere, so here we go.

For now, the only (kind of) complete section is the one about React Native.

**This project is still recent, I will add more content very soon.**
