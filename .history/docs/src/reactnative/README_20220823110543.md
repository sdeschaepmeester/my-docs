# Introduction

I use react-native for my mobile game project.

You can use [Expo](https://expo.dev/) in a react native project, if you want to use features such as debugging on your phone, hot reload etc.

## Using Class Components vs Functional Components

Years ago, React Native developers used mostly class components.
Class components can use specific methods working around the class's life cycle such as *ComponentDidMount*, *ComponentWillUpdate*, etc.

Now, we mostly use functional components.
Functional components are useful as they allow you to use hooks, *useState* and more.

There are more information about the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-functional-components-and-class-components-in-react/" style="color:green">differences between the two here.</a>
