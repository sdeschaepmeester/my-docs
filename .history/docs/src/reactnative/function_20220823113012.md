# Functional Component

At the start of my react native mobile game project, I had made the mistake of only using Class Components.

This led to numerous problems, especially around the fact that I could not use hooks or useState.

I had to migrate all the files.

See below the structure of all important elements I had to migrate:

## Functional Component structure

```js
const MyComponent = ({ parameters }) => {
	return (
		<View>
		</View>
	);
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Function structure

```js
const myFunction = (eventualParameters) => {
	/// Function body
}
```

## Using a useState

1. Import the useState

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

```


2. Use the useState inside the component

```js
const MyComponent = ({ parameters }) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	return (
		<View>
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                <Text>My button</Text>
            <TouchableOpacity>
		</View>
	);
}
```
