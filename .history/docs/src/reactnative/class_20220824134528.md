# Class Component

Class component are one of the core elements of React Native.

That being said, developers uses them less and less, prefering functional component.

At the start of my mobile game project, I didn't know that and made the mistake of using only class components.

This mean I used methods such as **ComponentDidMount**, **ComponentDidUpdate** instead of hooks which will cause problems later in the development.

## Class Component structure

```js
export default class Dance extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <View>
            </View>
        );
    }
}
```

A class component is structured as follow:

* **A constructor**: You instanciate properties, states in there.
* **Eventual methods**: All the functions are contain within the component.
* **A render method**: The elements you want to display.

## Function structure

```js
myFunction(){
    // Function body
}
```

## Using a state

**States** are specific variables you can modify with functions. Modifying such variables will cause the component to rerender.

```js
    // Create a state variable
    this.state = { myVariable: "hello" };

    // Call a state variable
    console.log(this.state.myVariable);

    // Modify a state variable
    this.setState({ myVariable: "world" });
```

## Using a reference

Using a **reference** can allow you, for example, to call a specific component's function.

```js
<MyComponent ref={ref => (this.myComponent = ref)}  />
```

## Using componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount

There are different methods which are triggered depending on the component's life cycle.

These methods are:

| Methods | When is it triggered |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| componentDidMount | Called right after the render of the component. |
| componentDidUpdate | Called right after the component was updated.  |
| componentWillUnmount | Called right before the component stopped being rendered. |

## Using intervals

:::tip Note
When using an interval, always instanciate it inside the componentDidMount method and clear it inside the componentWillUnmount method.
:::

componentDidMount(){
    }
    componentWillUnmount(){
        this.intervalSprites.clearInterval();
        this.intervalTimer.clearInterval();
    }
